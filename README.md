### Features

- Ultra-low risk – target $0.01 per side (UP and/or DOWN)
- Exploits liquidity shifts in the crypto 5-minute up/down market
- When liquidity changes, winning shares can be had for $0.01
- Same market structure; different entry (one or both sides at minimal size)

### How It Works

1. Finds the current crypto up/down market  
2. Monitors liquidity – buys UP and/or DOWN (generally one of both) with ~$0.01  
3. When liquidity has changed, positions bought at $0.01 can become winning shares  
4. Redeems winning side or merges if both filled; repeats for the next market
